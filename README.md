# Depth Ranger

**Depth Ranger** is a training aid for barbell squats that helps lifters monitor squat depth in real-time. It provides audible and visual feedback when the lifter passes the parallel threshold, aiding with proper form, pausing, and rep tracking. Ideal for both training and competition prep, Depth Ranger adapts to multiple users and customizable settings.

## Features

### Real-Time Depth Feedback
- **Squat Depth Detection**: Measures the distance from the barbell to the floor and detects when the user passes parallel by a user set colored light (hip crease at or below knee).
- **Audible Cues**: Beeps when parallel is passed.
- **Pause Assistance**: In training mode, helps users maintain pause squats by timing the pause duration after passing parallel.

### Training & Competition Modes
- **Training Mode**:
  - Beeps and flashes LED when squat passes parallel.
  - Tracks reps: distinguishes between reps that were and were not to depth.

- **Competition Mode**:
  - Silent during squat (no beeps or lights).
  - Provides post-rep feedback.
  - Can track reps if performing for multiple repetitions.
